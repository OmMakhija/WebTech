    <h1>Mathematical Formulas</h1>

    <h2>a. Area of a Circle</h2>
    <p>The area of a circle with radius 'r' is given by:</p>
    <p>Area = π * r^2</p>

    <h2>b. Trigonometric Identities with angle α</h2>
    <p>Replace this with your trigonometric identities involving α.</p>

    <h2>c. Square of (a+b)</h2>
    <p>(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2</p>

    <h2>d. Cube of (a+b)</h2>
    <p>(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3</p>

    <h2>e. Difference between squares of two variables</h2>
    <p>If you have two variables 'x' and 'y', the difference between their squares is:</p>
    <p>x^2 - y^2</p>

    <h2>f. Time Period of a Pendulum</h2>
    <p>The time period 'T' of a simple pendulum is given by:</p>
    <p>T = 2π * √(l/g)</p>

    <h2>g. Gravitational Force</h2>
    <p>The gravitational force 'F' between two objects with masses 'm1' and 'm2' and separated by a distance 'r' is given by:</p>
    <p>F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2</p>

    <h2>h. Kinetic Energy</h2>
    <p>The kinetic energy 'K' of an object with mass 'm' and velocity 'v' is given by:</p>
    <p>K = 0.5 * m * v^2</p>

    <h2>i. Relation between Mass and Energy</h2>
    <p>The relation between mass 'm' and energy 'E' is described by Einstein's famous equation:</p>
    <p>E = mc^2</p>

    <h2>j. Relation between Density (ρ), Mass, and Volume</h2>
    <p>The density 'ρ' of an object is defined as its mass 'm' divided by its volume 'V':</p>
    <p>ρ = m / V</p>
